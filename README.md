### What is in this repository?
I have created this repository as apart of my studies within Data Analytics. The chosen area for the research for this assignment is apart of Machine Learning.
<br>
The aim of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding and knowledge of the Boston House Prices dataset through the form of research and the use of descriptive statistics and plots. <br>
It is my intention to portray this through the use of the Python packages scipy, keras and jupyter.
<br>
This repository will contain a combination of: </br>
- Text
- Code
- Images & Graphs
<br>
<br>

### How to use Jupyter Notebook
To complete my assignment, I am using Jupyter Notebook which will allow me to complete updates on my assignment locally and then push the updates to Github where my repository shall live. <br>
The Jupyter Notebook is ran from within a web browser on your machine. <br>
In order to run Jupyter Notebook on a machine, firstly the Python programming language needs to be installed on this machine. <br>
I have Python installed already via the Anaconda package which I downloaded directly from the website.
https://www.anaconda.com/download
<br>
__"While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook itself."__ https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/jupyter/latest/jupyter.pdf
<br>

The Jupyter Notebook is called from within the interpreter application of your machine. <br>
The machine that you are using will determine the name of the command interpreter that you use. <br>
Some examples include: 
- Command Prompt
- Terminal
- Cmder
<br><br>

#### To run the Jupyter Notebook: 
1. Open the command interpreter application
2. Go to the desired folder via the command: _cd + the folder path_
3. Open Jupyter with this folder content by typing _jupyter lab_ OR _jupyter notebook_
4. After a few minutes, Jupyter will open and launch via a web browser where you can then interact and edit the notebook via the web application. Please be aware that Jupyter works best ran through the browsers Chrome or Firefox.

For this assignment, I chose to _clone_ my repository from Github.com to my machine. Then each time I made a contribution to my notebook, I pushed these updates to the repository on Github via the command interpreter. https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository 
<br>
__How to commit a notebook to a Github repository__
- Once you are finished working on a Jupyter notebook within a browser, choose File-> Save and then close all browser tabs relating to Jupyter.
- The command interpreter ends the live connection of the Jupyter notebook. To do this in Windows Command Prompt, the shortcut is CTRL + C
- To check which files are currently 'untracked' by Git, enter _git status_
- To choose to send everything which is untracked, run _git add ._ 
- To prepare these files to send to Git, _git commit -m "Comment for commit"_
- Sends these files to Git - _git push_ 
- Once completed, please ensure to check GitHub.com to ensure that these commits appear on your repositorY before closing down Command Prompt.

More indepth instructions of how to complete this can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

<br>

While using the Juypter Notebook, the Command window remains open in the background creating backups of your content from Jupyter. It is best practice to close all Jupyter Notebook tabs <strong>before</strong> interacting with the Command window. <br>
