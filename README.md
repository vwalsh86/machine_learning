### What is in this repository?
I have created this repository as apart of my studies within Data Analytics. The area of research for this assignment is apart of Machine Learning.
<br>
The aim of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding and knowledge of the Boston House Prices dataset through the form of research and the use of descriptive statistics and plots. <br>
It is my intention to portray this through the use of the Python packages scipy, keras and jupyter.
<br>
This repository will contain a combination of: </br>
- Text
- Code
- Images & Graphs
<br>
This repository was originally created on Github.com but I have chosen to complete updates via my machine using a Jupyter Notebook. I will then send the updates / commits from machine to the repository. To do this, I needed to clone the repository to my machine and then use the command interpreter application to send the commits to GitHub.com - I have included instructions to do this below.
<br>
The Jupyter Notebook is called from within the command interpreter application of your machine. <br>
The machine that you are using will determine the name of the command interpreter that you use. <br>
Some examples include: 
- Command Prompt
- Terminal
- Cmder
<br>
To begin a session with Jupyter, you call it from the command interpreter application. I am using Windows so the application I have chose to use is Command Prompt. Once called, the Jupyter Notebook is ran from within a web browser on your machine. <br>

### How to use Jupyter Notebook
To run Jupyter Notebook on a computer, the Python programming language needs to be installed firstly on the machine. <br>
I have Python installed already via the Anaconda package which I downloaded directly from the website.
https://www.anaconda.com/download
<br>
> "While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook itself."

<br><br>

For this assignment, I chose to _clone_ my repository from Github.com to my machine. Then each time I made a contribution to my notebook, I pushed these updates to the repository on Github via the command interpreter. https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository 
<br>

### To run the Jupyter Notebook:

1. Open the command interpreter application
2. Go to the desired folder via the command: _cd + the folder path_
3. Open Jupyter with this folder content by typing _jupyter lab_ OR _jupyter notebook_
4. After a few moments, Jupyter will open and launch via a web browser where you can then interact and edit the notebook via the web application. Please be aware that Jupyter works best ran through the browsers Chrome or Firefox.

### How to commit a notebook to a Github repository

<br>

While using the Juypter Notebook, the Command window remains open in the background creating backups of your content from Jupyter. It is best practice to close all Jupyter Notebook tabs __before__ interacting with the Command window. <br>

- Once you are finished working on a Jupyter notebook within a browser, choose File-> Save and then close all browser tabs relating to Jupyter.
- The command interpreter is used to end the live connection with Jupyter notebook. To do this in Windows Command Prompt, the shortcut is CTRL + C
- To check which files are currently 'untracked' by Git, enter _git status_
- To choose to send everything which is untracked, enter _git add ._
- To prepare these files to send to Git enter _git commit -m "Comment for commit"_
- Sends these files to Git enter _git push_ 
- Once completed, check GitHub.com to ensure that these commits appear on your repository before closing down the Command Prompt.
